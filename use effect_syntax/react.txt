                         Day1 react

1.Why React Was Launched — The Main Reasons
Too much manual DOM manipulation
Before React, developers had to use plain JavaScript or jQuery to update HTML elements manually.
That was slow, error-prone, and hard to manage as apps got larger.
React introduced the Virtual DOM, which updates only what’s necessary — making apps much faster.    

2.whatis different between html webpage and react webpage?
What it is:
An HTML webpage is built using:
HTML (structure)
CSS (style)
JavaScript (behavior)
Everything is static unless you manually update it with JavaScript or reload the page.
react
A React webpage is built using JavaScript + JSX (HTML-like code).
It’s dynamic, component-based, and automatically updates parts of the page when data changes — without reloading.


3.what is different between react and angular

Learning Curve   | Easier to start                                                  | Steeper (more complex)                                              |
Data Binding   | One-way (unidirectional)                                         | Two-way binding                                                     |
DOM               | Virtual DOM (faster)                                             | Real DOM (via change detection)                                     |
Architecture      | View library only — needs other libraries (like Redux or Router) | Complete MVC/MVVM framework (comes with routing, forms, HTTP, etc.) |
Performance      | Very fast (thanks to Virtual DOM)                                | Slightly slower for big apps                                        |

Flexibility       | High — you choose tools                                          | Low — Angular decides structure                                     |
Community Support | Very large and active                                            | Also large, but more structured                                    
Best For          | Interactive UI, SPAs, dashboards                                 | Enterprise-scale complex apps  


4.what is typescritpt
Definition
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript — meaning it builds on top of JavaScript by adding types.
So every valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code, but TypeScript gives you extra features like type checking and better code tools.

Static Typing:
You can define data types (like string, number, boolean) to catch errors before running the code.

Compile-time Checking:
TypeScript code is checked before running, so you can find bugs early.

Object-Oriented Features:
It supports classes, interfaces, and inheritance, making code more structured

Better Tooling:
Editors like VS Code give smart suggestions, autocompletion, and error highlighting.


what is variable
A variable is a name used to store data in a program — like a box that holds a value.
You can put data in it, use it, and change it later.
example
let name = "Ranjith";
let age = 21;

name and age are variables.
"Ranjith" (text) and 21 (number) are the values stored in them.

Why We Use Variables
To store data (like name, number, or result)
To reuse values easily
To change data while the program runs

| Keyword | Meaning                           |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| `var`   | Old way (not recommended now)     |
| `let`   | Modern, allows value changes      |
| `const` | Used for values that never change |

5 .what is declaration
A declaration means telling the computer that a variable, function, or constant exists — giving it a name and sometimes a value.
In simple words:
A declaration is when you introduce something to your program for the first time.
example
let name;

6.what is initilations?
Initialization means giving a value to a variable for the first time after (or while) you declare it.

In simple words 👇
 Declaration = creating the variable
 Initialization = assigning its first value
 example
 let name;           // Declaration
name = "Ranjith";   // Initialization

7.what is black scope
Block scope means a variable is only available (can be used) inside the block { } where it is declared.
A block is any code written inside { }, like in if statements, loops, or functions.
example
{
  let name = "Ranjith";
  console.log(name); // ✅ Works here
}

console.log(name);   //  Error: name is not defined


8.what is function scope
Function scope means a variable is only available inside the function where it is declared.
You cannot use it outside that function.
variables declared inside a function belong only to that function
example
function greet() {
  let name = "Ranjith";  // function-scoped variable
  console.log("Hello, " + name); //  Works here
}

greet();       // Output: Hello, Ranjith
console.log(name); // Error: name is not defined


9.what is hosting scope?
Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before code execution.
Only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization.
This applies to var variables and function declarations.
var example
console.log(name); // Output: undefined
var name = "Ranjith";
console.log(age); //  Error: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
let age = 21;

 10.what is closore scope?
A closure is when a function “remembers” 
the variables from the scope where it was created, even after that scope has finished
executing.
A function can access variables from its outer function even if the outer function is done running.
inner() is a closure
Even after outer() finishes, inner() remembers name

11. what is lixical scope?
Lexical scope means:
The scope of a variable is determined by where it is written in the code (the structure of the code), not by where it is called.
A function can access variables that were defined in the place where the function was created.


12. in web development process why node is coming which in come first
 react node,angular?
 For beginners or in a project:
Node.js first
Understand how JavaScript works on the server
Learn basic backend: HTTP requests, REST APIs, databases
React or Angular next
Build the frontend UI
Connect to backend APIs (Node.js)
Why Node comes first?
Because frontend frameworks need data from somewhere (server/database).
Node gives you the environment to create that backend using the same JavaScript you already know from the frontend.
